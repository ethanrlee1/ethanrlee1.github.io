        <h2>Contract</h2>
        <p class="text">
            I, Ethan R Lee, agree to abide by the terms of the course contract in my Spring 2025, ITIS3135, Web-Based Application Design and Development with my instructor, Professor D.I. von Briesen.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
            I understand that all work that I do on publicly available online tools will be available to the world, and will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
            I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absences.
        </p>
