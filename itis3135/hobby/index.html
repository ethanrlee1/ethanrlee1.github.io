            <h2>Best Times</h2>
            <p>I had done taekwondo since I was ten and continued to do so for more than a decade. I founded friends and family while being there. Though the classes are taken seriously, we had fun times and goofy moments. I ended up getting my third degree black belt shortly before starting at UNC Charlotte.</p>

            <h2>How It Works</h2>
            <p>In my experince we have taekwondo instructors teach techniques and forms to the students. After learning and mastering them, they are put through a test before moving up the next belt color. Tests and techniques get more advanced and difficult as you move to the next belt color.</p>

            <h2>Why I Did It?</h2>
            <p>When I was younger, my parents had me try out multiple different sports. None of them stuck with me, till I tried taekwondo. I always thought the reason my dad registered me for it was that I needed self-defense as I was bullied alot in elementary. After a decade of practicing, I can condfidently say it was the right sport for me.</p>

            <p>I highly reccomend it for anyone as an option for a sport. It is fun and stress reliving.</p>
